# Advanced-Computer-Architecture-Final-Project

This paper will be on the Flush + Reload side channel attack. First, we’ll discuss the cache hierarchy and page sharing, and how page sharing can present vulnerabilities. Then, we’ll go into details of the flush + reload attack and how the attacker can gain information by using this vulnerability. Next, we’ll talk about the applications of the attack, first by discussing a paper that demonstrates how RSA encryption private key can be compromised by using this type of attack. Then, we’ll talk about another paper detailing how the attack can be used on a victim using a web browser to see which web pages the victim has been visiting.
